<p>I have created the<strong> #alumni</strong> channel on Discord as well as the Alumni role so you can network with other graduates. Please let myself or the management team know that you have finished the course so you can get the alumni badge in the community! Simply post your completion certificate in the <strong>#alumni</strong> channel and tag the @Management&nbsp;Team. If you have finished the course&nbsp;I highly recommend you join the channel and stay up to date and network throughout your career. You never know how it may come in handy in the future.<br><br>It would be great to have the alumni follow up on their career journey such as: *<strong>Did they find a new job?</strong>* or *<strong>Did they enroll&nbsp;in some further study?</strong>* or even *<strong>Did they launch&nbsp;their own business/product?</strong>*&nbsp;<br><br>Many students would benefit from this and I hope you give back a bit to the community :)</p>
