### ViewPort with Safari as Example
* Visible area of the Webpage
* If the webpage is larger than the viewport, then the user scrolls to see more of the webpage
* When the viewport is resized, Safari may change the document’s layout—for example, expand or shrink the width of the text to fit. If the webpage is smaller than the viewport, it is filled with white space to fit the size of the viewport
