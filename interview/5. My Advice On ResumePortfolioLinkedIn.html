<h4>This is just my personal advice. Depending on cultures, economic situations and other factors not all of this may apply. Use this not as the only method, but as a source for ideas:&nbsp;<br><br>Resume</h4>

<p>Resumes are the bane to everyone’s existence. Nobody likes writing them, and no employer offers a job solely because of somebody’s resume. So you need to treat it accordingly: A way to get interviews (you will soon see that it’s not the only way). Spend very little amount of time on your resume (no longer than 1 day). Look at the types of jobs that you want to have, and have the words and characteristics described in these job positions in your resume. Finally, make it personal for each position you apply to so that the employer’s name is on the resume. It will take you 10 seconds, but it already puts you above most people that just send mass amounts of resumes.</p>



<h4>LinkedIn</h4>



<p>Update your LinkedIn profile with the skills that you have and according to the jobs you are targeting. Recruiters will use LinkedIn to look for candidates and they will always search for users who have recently changed their profiles since this signals to them that this person is looking for a job. Therefore, try and update your LinkedIn profile every two days (this can be as simple as a word change). If you have listed skills that are in demand (i.e. Javascript, Node.js, React) you will have these recruiters messaging you for opportunities daily.</p><h4>An Alternative To Resumes</h4><p>The above methods are pretty basic. Let’s start to get creative. Instead of sending your resume, I usually email a company I am interested in working with/&nbsp;Don’t send a resume, but instead send them your personal website (You can use the sample apps you have built in this course!)&nbsp;and tell them why you want to work at the company. Ask them if you can come by for an interview. You can send this message to the head HR person or someone who is a gatekeeper. Using tools like LinkedIn you will be able to easily find who this person is in the company.<br></p>



<h4>An Event Better Alternative</h4>



<p>Message lead developers, or CTOs at companies that you are interested in, and let them know your interest in getting to where they are professionally. Ask to take them out for coffee, or come by the office to chat to them about their careers. Never ask them for a job. But at the end, inquire if they have anybody that they recommend you speak to. Really emphasize in this meeting your goal to learn by working amongst smart developers. If they are not looking to hire, they will direct you to someone that is.</p>



<h4>The Best Alternative</h4>



<p>Message CEOs and ask what technical problems they are having. Tell them what technologies you are an expert in (by this point you should know whether they require people with your skills), and ask to solve a real life problem that they have free of charge. They can keep the work, and in return all you ask for is an interview.</p>





<p>Don’t ever just send mass amounts of resumes. Select the jobs that you want, personalize your emails and try to avoid sending a resume. Try to bypass formalities of an application process by getting an interview right away. Most likely during the interview they will ask you for a resume, but by that point you have already gotten what you needed.</p>
