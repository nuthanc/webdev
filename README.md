# Webdev course by Andrei

### HTML vs HTML5
* HTML5 is more semantic
* Also improves the performance of the web

### Copy a Website
* Good website to read: waitbutwhy.com
* View Page Source 
* Copy and Paste into your file

### CSS
* Good resource: https://css-tricks.com/almanac/

### CSS selectors
```txt
> is for direct child
h2 > p
<h2><p></p><h2>
h2 as parent of p
<h2><div><p></p></div><h2>
Doesn't apply here

h2 p is for descendant
p in h2

+ is for adjacent sibling
```
* CSS selector game: https://flukeout.github.io/
* clear property for float

### CSS specificity
* ID in 100s
* Class, pseudo-class and attributes in 10s
* Elements in units
