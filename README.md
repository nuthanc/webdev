### How the Internet Works
* Let's say, when we type google.com in our Browser, what happens?
* The request goes to the ISP, then to DNS and we get an IP which is sent back to our Browser
* The Browser makes a request to this IP
* The Google server responds with HTML, CSS and JS files

### WWW vs Internet
* Comparison: Internet->Smartphone and WWW->Instagram on that Smartphone
* WWW is essentially a common language for computers to speak to each other
