### HTTP

* HTTP is a common language that a client and server can use to communicate
* Requests and Responses
* Requests
  * GET
  * POST
  * PUT
  * DELETE
* Response
  * Status Code
  * HTML, CSS, JS documents etc

### HTTPS

* The password if sent is present in Query Parameter of Request body
* A malicious can get this if they are monitoring our network
* But if we use HTTPS, the message is encrypted
* Uses TLS(Transport Layer Security) or its predecessor SSL(Secure Socket Layer)

### JSON

* We needed a standard way of sending data
* For ex: if we send JS object, then the backend server which may be Python won't understand it
* So we have JSON and XML, but JSON is more efficient
* JSON is text, written with Javascript object notation
